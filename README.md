#*RNA Binding Protein Motif Mapping on Viral Genome*

This script maps RNA binding protein (RBP) motifs on a viral genome. It uses the motifs obtained from the ATtRACT database for RNA binding proteins and maps their occurrences on the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The script also includes functionality to retrieve UniProt IDs for each RNA binding protein in the dataset.This can be used for other Viral genomes as well.

#Requirements

* pandas
* Biopython
* matplotlib
* unipressed

You can install these packages using the following command in python:
pip install pandas biopython matplotlib unipressed
